My Dictionary

My Dictionary allows the user to enter a collection of words and give each word as many definitions as they want. New words can be added from the home page and each entry will be displayed on the home page as well. Clicking on a word will take the user to a unique page for that word and will display any definitions given to the word. From this page the user can enter additional definitions.
